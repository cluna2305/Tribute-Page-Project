# Tribute-page-project
This is a project that was required to complete the HTML/CSS course on codecamp. it was optional but i thought it was very fun!
This was done on codepen so it might look off here but i thought this should be included just in case.
you can look at how the page looks by going to my codepen page to see it in action. https://codepen.io/cluna2305/pen/KKpqePG
